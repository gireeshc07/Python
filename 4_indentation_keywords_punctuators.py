
# Python Indentation:
'''
-> Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
-> Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
-> Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

e.g. '''

if 5>2:
    print("Yes")
    
'''
-> Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

e.g. '''

# if 5>2:
# print("Yes") # IndentationError will raise

'''
-> The no. of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it must be at least one.

e.g. '''

if 5>2:
    print("Yes")
if 5>2:
    print("No")
    
'''
-> You must use the same no. of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.

e.g. '''

# if 5>2:
#     print("Yes")
#         print("No")  # IndentationError will raise


# Python Keywords:
'''
-> Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes. 
-> They cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, etc.) because they are integral to the syntax and structure of the 
   language. 
-> Therefore, Keywords are essential for defining the syntax and structure of Python code. Understanding them is crucial for programming 
   effectively in Python.
-> As of the latest version, Python has 35 keywords.'''
