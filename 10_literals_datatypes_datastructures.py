# What Are Python Literals?
'''
-> Literals in Python are fixed, constant values directly written into the code. 
-> Unlike variables, literals cannot be modified during the program's execution. 
-> They represent specific, concrete data of a particular type, such as integers, strings, or booleans.'''

# Purpose: To represent fixed data directly in your code.
# Applications: Found in every aspect of programming, from basic assignments to complex systems.

# Key Characteristics of Python Literals:

# 1. Represents Data: A literal is data in its raw form (e.g., 5, "Hello"). They are written as-is in the code, without requiring further computation.
# 2. Immutable: Once defined, the literal itself cannot be changed, though it can be reassigned. For example, the string "Python" will always remain "Python".
# 3. Data-Type Specific: Each literal belongs to a specific data type (e.g., integer, float, string, boolean). Operations on literals depend on their type.

# Key Categories:

# 1. Numeric Literals
'''
1. Integer Literals
2. Floating-point Literals
3. Complex Literals
'''
# 2. Sring Literals(Characters)
# 3. Boolean Literals
'''
1. True
2. False
'''
# 4. Special Literals
'''
1. None Literal
'''
# 5. Collections Literals
'''
1. List Literals
2. Tuple Literals
3. Dictionary Literals
4. Set Literals
5. Frozenset Literals
'''
# 6. Binary Literals
'''
1. Bytes Literals
2. bytearray Literals
3. Memoryview literals
'''
# Note: range() is not a literal

# Real-Life Analogy:
'''
-> Imagine you’re ordering a coffee. The size, "Medium", and the quantity, 2, are fixed, unchanging values you’re using for this order.'''

coffee_size = "Medium"  # String literal --> Represents the fixed name of the size.
coffee_quantity = 2     # Integer literal --> Specifies how many cups you want.
'''
-> Here, "Medium" and 2 are literals because they directly represent the value for the size and quantity.'''

# Why Are Python Literals Important?

# 1. Foundation of Programming:
'''
-> Literals are the building blocks of Python programming. They provide the basic elements that define program logic and behavior.'''

# 2. Defines Code Behavior:
'''
-> The type of a literal determines the operations that can be performed on the data. For example:
   - String Literal: "Hello" supports operations like concatenation (+) or slicing.
   - Numeric Literal: 42 allows arithmetic operations such as addition or multiplication.'''

# 3. Improves Debugging:
'''
-> Mistaking a string literal ("100") for a numeric literal (100) can cause errors in calculations.'''

# 4. Real-World Applications:
'''
-> Literals allow you to represent real-world data effectively:
   - Boolean Literal: True for a user's login status.
   - Numeric Literal: 3.14 for scientific calculations.
   - String Literal: "Hello" for greeting messages.'''

# Why Is It Crucial to Understand Python Literals?

# 1. Better Control Over Data:
'''
-> Understanding literals ensures that you:
   - Store data in the correct format.
   - Use the right type of literal for the task at hand.'''

# e.g.,
# Use numeric literals for calculations
sales_target = 100  # Integer literal
pi_value = 3.14  # Float literal

# Use string literals for messages or labels
welcome_message = "Welcome to Python!"
  
# 2. Facilitates Problem Solving:
'''
-> Literals allow programmers to model and solve real-world problems efficiently.'''

# e.g.,
# Boolean literal for task completion
is_task_complete = True  

# Integer literal for tracking items
items_in_cart = 3  

# 3. Key to Efficient Programming:
''' 
-> Choosing the right literal type improves code readability and performance.'''

# e.g.,
# Integer literals for exact quantities:
distance = 42  # Integer literal

# String literals for user-friendly messages:
status_message = "Processing your request..."

# 4. Foundation for Advanced Topics:
'''
-> A strong understanding of literals prepares you for advanced programming concepts such as:
  - Data structures (lists, dictionaries).
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP).'''

# By knowing Python literals, you build a solid base for writing accurate, efficient, and clear Python programs.

# 2. Python Data Types:
'''
-> Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable's data type explicitly—it’s inferred from the value assigned. 
-> Data types are very important in programming. These are the categories that specify what type of data that can be stored in variables and determine what kind of operations can be 
   performed on the data.
-> Understanding data types is fundamental to writing efficient and error-free programs.
'''
# Purpose: To categorize data and define the operations that can be performed on it.
# Applications: Data types are essential in every Python program, from simple tasks like arithmetic to complex systems involving data structures and algorithms.

# Key Characteristics of Python Data Types:

# 1. Dynamic Typing:
'''
-> In Python, you don’t need to declare a variable’s type explicitly. The type is determined by the value assigned.'''

# e.g.,
a = 10        # 'a' is an integer
a = "Python"  # Now 'a' is a string

# 2. Everything is an Object:
'''
-> All data types in Python are classes, and variables are instances of these classes.'''

# e.g.,
print(type(10))  # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type("Python"))  # Output: <class 'str'>

# 3. Mutability vs. Immutability:
'''
-> Mutable types (like lists and dictionaries) can be changed after creation.
-> Immutable types (like strings, integers, and tuples) cannot be modified.'''

# Key Categories:

# 1. Numeric Types
'''
1. Integer -- <class 'int'>
2. Float -- <class 'float'>
3. Complex -- <class 'complex'>
'''
# 2. Text Type
'''
1. String -- <class 'str'>
'''
# 3. Sequence Type
'''
1. List -- <class 'list'>
2. Tuple -- <clss 'tuple'>
3. Range -- <class 'range'>
'''
# 4. Mapping Type
'''
1.Dictionary -- <class 'dict'>
'''
# 5. Set Types
'''
1. Set -- <class 'set'>
2. Frozenset -- <class 'frozenset'>
'''
# 6. Boolean Type
'''
1. Boolean -- <class 'bool'>
# no constructor for NoneType
'''
# 7. NoneType
'''
1. None -- <class 'NoneType'>
'''
# 8. Binary Types
'''
1. Bytes -- <class 'bytes'> (immutable)
2. Bytearray -- <class 'bytearray'> (mutable)
3. Memoryview -- <class 'memoryview'>
'''
# Real-Life Analogy:
'''
-> The label "Medium" is a string (text), and the quantity 2 is an integer (whole number). The data type determines how these values are interpreted and 
   manipulated.'''

print(type(coffee_size))       # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(coffee_quantity))   # Output: <class 'int'>
'''
-> Here, str and int are data types, defining what kind of data "Medium" and 2 are.'''

# Why Are Python Data Types Important?

# 1. Efficient Memory Usage:
'''
-> Each data type has specific memory requirements. Using the appropriate data type ensures optimal memory utilization.'''

# e.g., 
# Using an int for counting items instead of a float saves memory.
items_count = 100

# 2. Facilitates Type-Specific Operations:
'''
-> Different data types support different operations. Knowing the data type ensures that you apply the correct methods or operators.'''

# e.g.,
# Strings can be concatenated with +, while integers can be added mathematically.

# String Concatenation
greeting = "Hello" + " World"
print(greeting) # Output: Hello World

# Integer Addition
sum = 10 + 20
print(sum) # Output: 30

# 3. Reduces Errors:
'''
-> Using the wrong data type can lead to errors or unexpected behavior. A solid understanding of data types prevents these issues.
'''

# e.g.,
# Attempting to divide a string by a number will raise an error.
age = "25"
# print(age / 5)  # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)
# Correct: Convert the string to an integer
print(int(age)/5) # Output: 5.0

# Attempting to concatenate a string with a number will raise an error
age = 25
# print("My name is John, I am " + age)  # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str 
# Correct: Convert the integer to a string
print("My name is John, I am " + str(age)) # Output: My name is John, I am 25

# 4. Enhances Code Readability
'''
-> When variables are used with clear and appropriate data types, the code becomes more intuitive and easier for others (or yourself) to understand and maintain.'''

# e.g., 
# A dictionary for mapping makes the code self-explanatory.
employee = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "department": "HR"}

# 5. Ensures Correct Data Modeling
'''
-> Choosing the right data type allows you to model the real-world problem accurately in your program.'''

# e.g.,
# Representing a collection of unique items as a set instead of a list can prevent duplication issues.
unique_items = {1, 2, 3}  # set

# 6. Enables Effective Data Validation
'''
-> Validating user input often involves checking and converting data types.'''

# e.g., 
# Converting string input to an integer before performing calculations.
age = input("Enter your age: ")  # Input is always a string
age = int(age)  # Convert to integer

# 7. Interoperability with Libraries
'''
-> Many Python libraries and frameworks rely on specific data types. Understanding these ensures smooth integration and usage.'''

# e.g., Pandas relies on list or dict for creating DataFrames.

# Key Differences Between Literals and Data Types:
'''
| Aspect            | Python Literals                           | Python Data Types                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Definition        | Fixed values written directly in the code.| Categories describing the type of data stored. |
| Example           | "Hello", 42, 3.14, True                   | str, int, float, bool, list                    |
| Purpose           | Represents the actual data.               | Defines the nature of the data.                |
| Mutability        | Immutable (values don’t change).          | Can change if variable values are updated.     |
| Real-Life Analogy | Literal values like "Apples" and 5.       | Categories like text, number, or list of items.|'''

# Combined Real-Life Analogy:
'''
-> Let’s take a shopping scenario:

-> You decide to buy 5 apples and write down "Apples" as the item name and 5 as the quantity.
  - Literals: "Apples" and 5 are fixed values you noted down.
  - Data Types: "Apples" is a string, and 5 is an integer.'''

# Python Code Representation:

item_name = "Apples"  # String literal, data type: str
quantity = 5          # Integer literal, data type: int

# Check types
print(type(item_name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
print(type(quantity))   # Output: <class 'int'>

# Conclusion:
'''
-> Literals are the actual fixed data you use in your program.
-> Data types define the nature of that data and dictate how it can be processed.'''
  
# Understanding both is crucial for writing robust Python programs that handle various types of data efficiently.

# Data Structures in Python:
'''
-> Data structures are ways of organizing, managing, and storing data in Python so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. 
-> Python provides a wide range of built-in and user-defined data structures to handle different types of data and their operations effectively.
'''
# Types of Data Structures in Python:

# 1. Built-in Data Structures: These are the default data structures provided by Python.

# 1. Lists (list)
# 2.Tuples (tuple)
# 3. Sets (set)
# 4. Frozen Sets (frozenset)
# 5. Dictionaries (dict)

# Note: The range() function and Binary Types (bytes, bytearray, and memoryview) are not considered part of Python's built-in data structures.

# 2. User-Defined Data Structures: These are data structures created by users to meet specific, custom requirements.

# 1. Stacks
# 2. Queues
# 3. Linked Lists
# 4. Trees
# 5. Graphs
# 6. Hash Maps (Hash Tables)
# 7. Heaps

# 3. Standard Libraries for Data Structures:

# -> Python provides modules that enhance data structure capabilities:

# 1. 'collections':
'''
-> 'deque' for double-ended queues.
-> 'Counter' for counting elements in a collection.
-> 'OrderedDict' for maintaining insertion order in dictionaries (important before Python 3.7).'''
# 2. 'heapq': For priority queues and heaps.
# 3. 'queue': For multi-threaded FIFO and LIFO queues.
# 4. 'array': Provides compact arrays of numeric types.

# Example for deque:

from collections import deque
dq = deque([1, 2, 3])
dq.appendleft(0)  # Add to the front
dq.pop()          # Remove from the end
print(dq)  # Output: deque([0, 1, 2])

# Why Are Data Structures Important:

# 1. Efficient Data Management: Data structures help organize data efficiently, enabling quick access and modification.

# 2. Real-World Applications:
'''
-> Lists for managing tasks.  
-> Dictionaries for creating look-up tables.  
-> Graphs for social networks and maps.'''

# 3. Optimized Algorithms: Different algorithms work best with specific data structures, ensuring optimal performance.

# Choosing the Right Data Structure:
'''
| Scenario                              | Best Data Structure     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Storing ordered data                  | List, Tuple             |
| Storing unique values                 | Set                     |
| Mapping keys to values                | Dictionary              |
| Hierarchical relationships            | Tree                    |
| Graph relationships                   | Graph                   |
| Stack-like operations                 | Stack                   |
| Queue-like operations                 | Queue                   |'''

# -> Understanding and using the right data structure is crucial for writing efficient, readable, and maintainable code in Python.
